# An Overview of King County's Real Estate Market Dynamics


### Introduction

King County is the most populated county in Washington State and is home to Seattle, a growing tech hub that is currently drawing more people into the county. However, the real estate sector has not been sufficiently responsive to meet the housing supply needs of this growing population. So, how can urban and real estate developers work to cater to the suppressed supply of homes in the region?

By leveraging data-driven insights, this project aims to uncover structural and environmental factors that have contributed to inflated house prices and provide strategic solutions to address the concurrent housing demand and supply problems. 


### Problem Statement

**Background:**
King county recorded the highest median home price of $1 million in 2022 which was driven by the growing, tech-influenced population. While very little can be done by the private sector to stifle the economic factors limiting affordable supply of homes, urban and real estate developers should incorporate structural factors that will mitigate the existing astronomical home prices without compromising comfort, in order to meet the increasing demand.


### Objectives:

**1. Analyze the impact of market entry and exit on house pricing:**

Investigate whether seasons have any impact on house pricing by analyzing the month sold. Determine whether house prices were influenced by the timing of their market entry.

**2. Assess the role of outdoor space in house prices:**

Evaluate the condition of the outdoor spaces, including waterfront and view, and their contribution to the overall pricing of homes.

**3. Explore the relationship between home layout and house prices:**

Analyze the impact of home layout, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and floors, on pricing. Identify areas where the layout can be modified to enhance affordability without compromising comfort.

**4. Develop a linear regression model to predict future house prices:**

Build and evaluate a linear regression model to forecast house prices. Provide real estate and urban developers with a predictive tool for estimating housing prices and supporting strategic decision-making in urban development.
