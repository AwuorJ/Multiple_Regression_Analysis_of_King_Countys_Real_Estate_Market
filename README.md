# An Overview of Real Estate Market Dynamics in King County


### Introduction

King County is the most populated county in Washington State and is home to Seattle, a growing tech hub that is currently drawing more people into the county. However, the real estate sector has not been sufficiently responsive to meet the housing supply needs of this growing population. So, how can urban and real estate developers work to cater to the suppressed supply of homes in the region?

By leveraging data-driven insights, this project seeks to provide strategic solutions to the factors influencing house pricing that need to be addressed in order to resolve the concurrent demand and supply problems.
